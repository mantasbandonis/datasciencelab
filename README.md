Data Science SBWL Course V
Multi Label Classification with data from the Worldbank.

How to set up the environment:


1) 4 separate jupyter notebooks, data is shared by csv exports, tested pip environments can be found in folder environments


2) file system must be structured as noted below:

			- notebooks
				-preparation.ipynb
				-vectorisation.ipynb
				-ML.ipynb
				-LabelMyData.ipynb
				- single_cases.csv		# one column containing descriptions of datasaets, another column containing titles
			- output
			- input
				- fillerwords.txt		# must contain words and characters which should be removed from the text, comma seperated list
				- tags_clean.csv		# contains a column of all tags, their frequency and an identifier if a tag should be removed
			- token
				- token.txt				# token for accessing the API to download the JSON files, must be requested
 
				
3) for executing vectorisation.ipynb the word embedding model set up on the server of the Wirtschaftsuniversit√§t Wien must be reachable
	- alternatively a local word embedding model must be set up 

4) notebooks must be run in following order:
			1. preparation.ipynb
			2. vectorisation.ipynb
			3. ML.ipynb
			4. LabelMyData.ipynb
